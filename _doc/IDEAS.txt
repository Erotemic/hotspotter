coverage measure - 
allocate a binary pixel mask for the query and result. 
for each matching keypoint warp a unit circle to an ellipse using inv(A)
mark that pixel as on
the ratio of on to off pixels is the coverage measure. 

ALTERNATIVE: Instead of on to off pixels, take all keypoints from the image
and warp them using the same technique. The ratio of this mask vs the
matching mask is the coverage measure.
