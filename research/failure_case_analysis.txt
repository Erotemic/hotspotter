qcx=GZ_305
qcx=GZ_111
first 4 are false matches
Reasons for failure:
* small (nondistinctive) keypoints match. 
Places where this occurs:
face - 
ridge of back
front chevron,



These descriptors tend to have one black bar running through the middle

dynamic scoring


changes: 
* dump images of individual matching keypoints. 
* the ones that scored really high. 

Contribution: 
* an open source system for instance recognition
* comparison to tf-idf bag-of-words
* comparison of descriptor types
* I am going to talk about these issues and how to solve them. 



PICK APPART GZ_111 vs GZ_305


Questions: 

I'm not sure that I'm plotting the keypoints correctly.

From the perdoch detector I get this: 

x, y - keypoint location
a, c, d - Lower triangular matrix A = [(a, 0),
                                       (c, d)]




1) You have animls you haven't seen before
2) Occlusions and viewpoint variations -> therefore you need multiple images
per animsl. 


Problem: Online recognition
Thousands of animals per day
Animals you haven't seen before 
Too many for manual verfication of everything 

Challenges / Contributions
1) Pose and viewpoint variations
2) Occlusions 
3) Similar appearances 
4) Incomplete views
5) Imperfect segmentation 


Proposed Contribution: 
1) Basic scoring mechanism (LNBNN vs TfIDF)
2) Decision involving multiple images per animal
- Driving appart true and false positives 
3) Dynamic database construction 
4) Construction of represntation of each animal including what to keep. 
(but not limited to)

We are in good shape on Scoring mechanism

we have some evidence that multi-iomage is correct but no mechanism. 
We have unclear results from our last paper
but the mechanism still needs to be investigated 

We have ideas on representation 


We dont understand the causes of failures


We dont have appropriate datasets
( * We want close to 1000 animals
  * 20 per animal at least (more is possible)
) 


Tasks:
Do my experiment  (ranked scores)
Organize datasets (with a script)

(mon and tues) Inventory and Aquisition 

(rest of the week) Detailed idea generation for all of our contributions
and evaluation. 



1) Online database where images are coming in sequentially 
 + we have a dynamic data structure
