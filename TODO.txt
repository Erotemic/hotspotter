#--- Feature ----

RCOS: The chip/image you have selected should be highlighted in the QItemTable
RCOS: Adding a chip should not draw the chip view. (by default. add option)
RCOS: The up/down arrow in the table should select the next image/chip. 
RCOS: Species selection of the chip.




Integrate scale threshold into libhesaff

Hendrik/Jason TODO: 
Finish the earth movers distance function in algos.py i.e.  Fix the linear
program in algos.py to compute the earth movers distance


Hendrik/Jason TODO: 
I would like there to be a text area that selects a cid (chip-id) whenever 
A) A user presses enter
B) A user enters enough information such that there is only one possible
chip-id he/she could select. (assuming they will not remove characters).
C) A user has changed information and the mouse moves (only if invalid).

Hendrik/Jason TODO: 
Autosave
#--- Annoyances ----

* Because we are using dcxs_ to make the uid for queries, there might be
* issue. dcids would cause issues too. Need to find a good way of determining
* uniqunes of a database. 

* Some Preferences need to invalidate the cache: (like changing the scale thresholds)

* ODD BEHAVIOR: where if you click the result inspection, its
* like clicking the result view. 

* TO DOCUMENT: You have the ability to control-click results to see homographies

* ODD BEHAVIOR: Sometimes matplotlib screw up capturing if you have control down or not

I should have a way of getting each individual chip interaction side by side
when I click on a query analaysis. (Oh, I sort of have it already...)

* sklearn doesnt work with pyinstaller
* skimage doesnt work with pyinstaller either

* When there is one chip in the database it reports a weird error on query.
* Make this error more descriptive. 

* Color by score in result inspection

#--- Issues ----

Caching Issue: Query Result saves in cx format indead of cid format.

Add Option: save_database on query

Disallow clicks to other figures in an interaction mode.

Fix depricated ginput

Enable editing of EXIF? At least properly display them

FIXED: ~~* Features seem to be loaded too often ~~
FIXED: ~~* Tail to nose select orientation does not allow correct direction selection.~
FIXED: ~~* switch to atan2~~
FIXED: ~~* add arrow widget ~~
FIXED: ~~Change file doesn't exist to Cache Miss~~
FIXED: ~~Get rid of the qon_list in dev.py~~
FIXED: ~~Utilize exif tags in images~~
FIXED: NEED TO REMOVE OLD CODE. 
~~ChipCompute recieved a divide by zero error when using target area. ~~
~~It must not be getting the valid cx list correctly. ~~
FIXED: ~~Get the spatial verification demo working. Homography seems to be broken. ~~
FIXED: ~~Try and fix these problems. ~~
FIXED ~~Prefs will load the old ChipConfig that belongs to FeatConfig instead of using
the new loaded ChipConfig? Somthing is screwy with Frogs here. ~~
FIXED ~~# Add option to force computation of queries
FIXED ~~# Add option to delete all precomputed queries
FIXED ~~* When editing the name of an animal, it has to redraw the chip and image ~~
        ~~* before the name editing can happen. ~~

Big thing is multiple views

Zebraness - 

Parts based recognition from non-forground 

Identificiation before species recognition 

Adaptive Scale and Coverarge

What happens when we have more than one view in the database

What is the right similarity measure

Turning scores into probabilities

Lets learn a threshold on bad matches. 

NEED ZEBRANESS + COLOR DESCRIPTORS
