#--- Annoyances ----

I should have a way of getting each individual chip interaction side by side
when I click on a query analaysis. (Oh, I sort of have it already...)

* sklearn doesnt work with pyinstaller
* skimage doesnt work with pyinstaller either

* When there is one chip in the database it reports a weird error on query.
* Make this error more descriptive. 

FIXED ~~* When editing the name of an animal, it has to redraw the chip and image ~~
        ~~* before the name editing can happen. ~~


#--- Issues ----

Query Result saves query indexes instead of query-ids

---

# Add option to force computation of queries
# Add option to delete all precomputed queries

Add Option: save_database on query

FIXED: ~~Get the spatial verification demo working. Homography seems to be broken. ~~
FIXED: ~~Try and fix these problems. ~~

Disallow clicks to other figures in an interaction mode.

Fix depricated ginput

HALF_FIXED: NEED TO REMOVE OLD CODE. 
ChipCompute recieved a divide by zero error when using target area. 
It must not be getting the valid cx list correctly. 


Tail to nose select orientation does not allow correct direction selection.
FIXED: ~~* switch to atan2~~
* add arrow widget 


Change file doesn't exist to Cache Miss
