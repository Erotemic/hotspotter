### NOTICE (2020-12-18): 

It looks like the main RPI website has been removed, although it can still be accessed via the wayback machine:
https://web.archive.org/web/20170602093944/http://cs.rpi.edu/hotspotter/


Dropbox should still be hosting the download links: 

* Win32 Installer: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5j1xyx2hq1wzqz2/hotspotter-win32-setup.exe?dl=0 

* OSX Installer: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0vzz3xnjbxhsda/hotspotter_installer_mac.dmg?dl=0

If you have access to a Linux machine or virtual machine I would recommend using IBEIS (https://github.com/Erotemic/ibeis) over HotSpotter. It's an improved version of the software. If you have linux with a python environment you can simply `pip install ibeis`, and then run `ibeis` to use it. The most recent README has installation and usage instructions. Also note, that while I'm not supporting HotSpotter with software updates (distribution of win32 exes was magic I don't know if I'll ever be able to capture again), I will support the IBEIS software with bug fixes and perhaps updates. 


Known Issues
------------

HotSpotter has known bugs. 


Occasionally it doesn't save a CSV correctly which results in this error:

```
error while blocking gui:ex=AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute'dtype''â€™,)
```

To fix it you need to open the image and annotation csv files corresponding to your database. There will likely be several lines in the annotation files that reference an image that doesn't exist in the images csv. Removing these lines and re-saving the CSV will resolve the issue. 


If you get a memory error, you are likely running out of RAM because your
database is too big for you computer.



Original README
