Quick Instructions: 

    Run the appropriate run-*-hotspotter-*.* command for your operating system. 

    If things don't work try running RUNME-to-fix-issues


Command Line Instructions: 
    To run hotspotter from the command line try: 
    python main.py

    I'd recommend using the QtConsole 
    ipython qtconsole --colors=Linux --autocall 2 --pylab=qt 

    in the console run 

    %run main.py 

    you will have a functional terminal as well as a gui
