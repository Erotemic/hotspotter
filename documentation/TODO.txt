                                Create a RawVisualModel who's object can be pickled. Same with RawResult, thats broken.
                                names and CIDs should be saved in filenames. Name manager can probably go away. 
                                Chips with names, but also names with chips.
                                Should be able to merge effortlessly into a more industrial quick readable/writable/parallizable databases. 
        0 | 13/05/08|            ____ |  Rework Facade, UIManager, and HotspotterAPI into two classes: an API and a frontend.

        4 | 13/05/08|            ____ |  Extend DataManager so it has an interface to a QtModel for data display. Right now data is displayed with an ItemBased Model in UIManager. This should change so the model is independent of the display choice. Allow for display in Tree or Table view.

        5 | 13/06/17|            ____ |  Name ID value of 1 is just a place-holder for everyone who has not been named yet.  We should probably fix this in the next version.
        5 | 13/06/17|            ____ |  Dont autoswitch views. Find a better way. A new dialog would probably be better. 
        5 | 13/06/17|            ____ |  View of of a certain name

        5 | 13/05/08|            ____ |  Add a batch query user mode.


        When reading in data, allow there to be a check to make 
        sure that all the images actually exist. 

        Or remove the image table entirely and just use the image names in a folder as the indexes, that shouldn't be so bad.
