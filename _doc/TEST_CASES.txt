New database
- new databases can be created intuitively

Open database 
- old databases can be opened intuitively
- databases in other formats (stripe spotter, old hotspotter versions) are
  converted automatically when opened

Save database
- The database saves its tables correctly to <dbdir>/.hs_internals

Import Images
- Images are moved into the <dbdir> image folder, added to tables
and are not moved if they are duplicated images. 


Query 
- Performs query on selected chip.
- Recomputes any dirty information.
- Results are correct even after applying other actions which modify the
  database (like adding a chip or changing a property)

Add Chip
- Can easilly select a new ROI to become a chip and it adds it self to the
  tables succesfully. 

Reselect ROI / Orientation
- Modifies selecected chip properties and removes old chip/feature info
- Ensures queries do not use old info 


Delete Chip
- Removes chip from tables 
- doesnt leave anything bad behind (like a png which could be mistaken for a
  new chips png)

Precompute Features 
- Reindexes and computes all chips and features. 


Pecompute Queries
- Runs all queries so results can be quickly viewed later. 


Layout Figures
- Figures never should go off the monitor


Edit Preferences
- Should be able to change algo settings on the fly and relevant computations
  implicitly marked as dirty and recomputed before any new query. 



Delete Computed Dir
- Correctly removes all precomputed files (but not the csv tables!)

Delete Global Dir
- Removes cached settings in ~/.hotspotter/global_cache
