Change back.fancy_headers to a default dictionary (in case properties are not in it)


OBSERVATION: 
Descriptors with too little "energy" match too easilly
Descriptors with too much "energy" match too randomly. 
The descriptors where some of the components are 0 but a fair number 
of other components are filled tend to be repeatable patterns. 


OBSERVATION: 
* Raise to algorithmic issue *
Lighting is a big deal. Histogram equalization can help, but it shouldn't be
applied to every image. It needs to be applied adaptively depending on how
dark the image is. Animals in shadows have no keypoints. 



#--- ALGORITHM ---
Changing the filter config is broken. Changing the LNBNN weight does nothing
because the feasibility check is not run on a change. Fix this. 
The whole filter config should just be fixed so it isn't stupid. 


Vizualize the Knth feature. 

#--- Feature ----


Add a #matches column to the results table
Let the user change chip properties from the results table. 

RCOS: Make use of hs.gx2_exif(1, tag='Orientation') to auto orient images

RCOS: The chip/image you have selected should be highlighted in the QItemTable
RCOS: Adding a chip should not draw the chip view. (by default. add option)
RCOS: The up/down arrow in the table should select the next image/chip. 
RCOS: Species annotation of the chip.
RCOS: Thumbnails.
RCOS: Reading EXIF data takes a long time. We need to do some caching. (Also parallelize it)
RCOS: The FNUMS should be able to be modified by the user so they can use more
      than one interaction at a time. 
RCOS: Autosave (with user checkbox)
RCOS:
I would like there to be a text area that selects a cid (chip-id) whenever 
A) A user presses enter
B) A user enters enough information such that there is only one possible
chip-id he/she could select. (assuming they will not remove characters).
C) A user has changed information and the mouse moves (only if invalid).

Add ability to trash images from the GUI

* SPEED UP ADDING CHIPS TO IMAGES
* Delay the computation of the chip as long as possible
* Delay the computation of the features even further

Need to have easier selection of ROIs. One click additions. 
Easy modifications. 

Add ability to orient an entire image. 


#--- Dev Testing Features ---

RCOS: I want a flag which sets the "work dir" for a user. Then I want a nice
way of getting that work dir from any place in the program. This will be a
developer tool.

#--- Annoyances ----


* chip_compute2 is too slow. This is because of two problems: 
    1) parallelize has to check to make sure all the chips are there.
       We should be able to make a much faster way of doing this by specifying
       the directory where they should be. (exists is slow)
    2) rsize_list has to be populated. 
       This should be fixable my adding an image property which specifies the
       size of the image. This data should be verified if reading an image
       fails, and it should be optional (ie, a None value means you have to
       read in the data)

* When adding a new ROI, the program goes through and deletes data that
* belongs to this new chip. It needs to do this in case a user made a bunch of
* chips and then deleted them and then added a bunch more. But it should be
* able to figure out when it doesnt need to do this to make the interface
* faster. 

When drawing ROIs theta is not always specified when it should be in
vizualizations. 

* Changing preferences from adaptive_scale=false to adaptive_scale=true does
* not do anything when a query has already been run. 

* Images like ._MPALA_STEWART_0232.JPG do not seem to be images. Do not add
* them as if they were

* Because we are using dcxs_ to make the uid for queries, there might be
* issue. dcids would cause issues too. Need to find a good way of determining
* uniqunes of a database. 

* Some Preferences need to invalidate the cache: (like changing the scale thresholds)

* ODD BEHAVIOR: where if you click the result inspection, its
* like clicking the result view. 

* TO DOCUMENT: You have the ability to control-click results to see homographies

* ODD BEHAVIOR: Sometimes matplotlib screw up capturing if you have control down or not

I should have a way of getting each individual chip interaction side by side
when I click on a query analaysis. (Oh, I sort of have it already...)

* sklearn doesnt work with pyinstaller
* skimage doesnt work with pyinstaller either

* When there is one chip in the database it reports a weird error on query.
* Make this error more descriptive. 

* Color by score in result inspection

#--- Issues ----

Caching Issue: Query Result saves in cx format indead of cid format.

Add Option: save_database on query

Disallow clicks to other figures in an interaction mode.

Fix depricated ginput

Enable editing of EXIF? At least properly display them

FIXED: ~~* Features seem to be loaded too often ~~
FIXED: ~~* Tail to nose select orientation does not allow correct direction selection.~
FIXED: ~~* switch to atan2~~
FIXED: ~~* add arrow widget ~~
FIXED: ~~Change file doesn't exist to Cache Miss~~
FIXED: ~~Get rid of the qon_list in dev.py~~
FIXED: ~~Utilize exif tags in images~~
FIXED: NEED TO REMOVE OLD CODE. 
~~ChipCompute recieved a divide by zero error when using target area. ~~
~~It must not be getting the valid cx list correctly. ~~
FIXED: ~~Get the spatial verification demo working. Homography seems to be broken. ~~
FIXED: ~~Try and fix these problems. ~~
FIXED ~~Prefs will load the old ChipConfig that belongs to FeatConfig instead of using
the new loaded ChipConfig? Somthing is screwy with Frogs here. ~~
FIXED ~~# Add option to force computation of queries
FIXED ~~# Add option to delete all precomputed queries
FIXED ~~* When editing the name of an animal, it has to redraw the chip and image ~~
        ~~* before the name editing can happen. ~~
FIXED ~~Integrate scale threshold into libhesaff~~
FIXED ~~Finish the earth movers distance function in algos.py i.e.  Fix the linear
        program in algos.py to compute the earth movers distance~~
