qcx=GZ_305
qcx=GZ_111
first 4 are false matches
Reasons for failure:
* small (nondistinctive) keypoints match. 
Places where this occurs:
face -

dynamic scoring


changes: 
* dump images of individual matching keypoints. 
* the ones that scored really high. 

Contribution: 
* an open source system for instance recognition
* comparison to tf-idf bag-of-words
* comparison of descriptor types
* I am going to talk about these issues and how to solve them. 



PICK APPART GZ_111 vs GZ_305


Questions: 

I'm not sure that I'm plotting the keypoints correctly.

From the perdoch detector I get this: 

x, y - keypoint location
a, c, d - Lower triangular matrix A = [(a, 0),
                                       (c, d)]
